# Data Product Management

This is a repository containing information about the Data Product Management Nanodegree at Udacity https://www.udacity.com/course/data-product-manager-nanodegree--nd030
in the first project.

We apply the skills acquired in this course to strategize how to unveil the first flying car taxi service, Flyber, in one of the most congested cities in America-- New York City. We are responsible for bringing the first flying car taxi service to market by analyzing data in Part 1 (Midterm) and building a product proposal in Part 2 (Final).

Summary of Findings

The solution provided has been thoight in the context of [Lower Manhattan Coastal Resiliency (LMCR)](https://edc.nyc/project/lower-manhattan-coastal-resiliency) which is the City’s plan to adapt Lower Manhattan to climate change, for this generation and the next.

In the Power Point Presentation flyber-mpv-launch-strategy-proposal.ppx are collected all findings after analyzing data provided in the notebooks in this repository.

This study’s findings demonstrate a need to protect the District comprehensively from a wide range of climate hazards – not only low frequency, extreme events, but also high frequency, lower intensity events and chronic conditions.

Impacts are organized by the climate hazards of storm surge, tidal inundation, groundwater table rise, extreme precipitation, and heat waves, and by the timeframes of 2050s and 2100. 

The analysis shows that Lower Manhattan is at risk of multiple types of flooding due to both climate events and chronic conditions. Adapting the District requires a comprehensive approach, tackling hazards with a wide range of solutions that are explored in following chapters.
