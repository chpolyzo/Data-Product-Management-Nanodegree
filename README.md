This is a repository containing information about the Data Product Management Nanodegree at Udacity https://www.udacity.com/course/data-product-manager-nanodegree--nd030
in the first project.
We apply the skills acquired in this course to strategize how to unveil the first flying car taxi service, Flyber, in one of the most congested cities in America-- New York City. We are responsible for bringing the first flying car taxi service to market by analyzing data in Part 1 (Midterm) and building a product proposal in Part 2 (Final).
